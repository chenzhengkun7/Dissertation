    "Although a significant amount of work in Industrial IoT has been applied to equipment monitoring, the bulk of the research on equipment monitoring has been performed without consideration for data transmission in a modern framework. For this reason, it is important to discuss the broad history of machine health monitoring and the methods used to perform the necessary analytics. Specifically, this review will focus on the application of machine health monitoring to vibrating systems such as rolling element bearings. Due to their ubiquity in manufacturing equipment and their importance in transmitting rotational mechanical energy, bearing analysis has been and will continue to be a significant focal point in the context of machine health monitoring research.\n"

    "Historically, vibration analytics have been performed through signal processing methods~\\cite{tandon_review_1999,rai_review_2016}. Typically, a vibration measurement device such as an accelerometer or acoustic emission sensor is placed on the housing of a rotating piece of machinery for data acquisition. Analytics on the resulting signal tend to reveal possible defects and end-of-life indicators. A number of these analysis tools are performed on time-domain data.\n",
