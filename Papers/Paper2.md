__Contextual Acquisition of Machine Health and Process Data in an IoT Framework__

_The advancement of the internet of things has led to new data acquisition and health monitoring strategies for manufacturing equipment. To leverage these technologies at scale, health data must be contextualized within current machine and process status. This paper introduces a strategy for automatic data contextualization which utililzes existing messaging standards in a 3-layer IoT architecture. This approach requires the concurrent acquisition of machine process and health data in addition to standardized message labeling and storage. Leveraging recently developed tools for these data acquisition tasks, a simple case study in health monitoring of a 3-axis mill is presented in this work. By leveraging message standardization practices, these strategies show promise for scaling to manufacturing environments._
