__Contextual Acquisition of Machine Health and Process Data in an IoT Framework__

The advancement of the internet of things has led to new data acquisition and health monitoring strategies for manufacturing equipment. To leverage these technologies at scale, health data must be contextualized within current machine and process status. This paper introduces a strategy for automatic data contextualization which utililzes existing messaging standards in a 3-layer IoT architecture. This approach requires the concurrent acquisition of machine process and health data in addition to standardized message labeling and storage.  


This chapter describes the methodology and design of an architecture for transmitting machine data from a factory floor to cloud storage for analysis and historical monitoring. Specifically, this architecture leverages modern web protocols such as MQTT to enable low-overhead bidirectional communication for data acquisition devices in a factory setting. Using a standardized messaging format, communication across a variety of machines may be facilitated. This architecture also incorporates the use of additional sensors for health monitoring. By leveraging CNC controller data to indicate the current operational state of a machine, sensor data are readily contextualized relative to machine status. Two simple case studies illustrate the usefulness of sensor data in detecting tool wear and tracking spindle health in a milling machine.
