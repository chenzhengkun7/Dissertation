__Edge vs Cloud: A Latency Comparison of Feature Extraction and Machine Learning Inference Approaches__

_As embedded computing devices and software continue to improve in efficiency and power, increasingly intricate computational tasks are made possible through edge computing. At the same time, cloud service providers have made remote computing increasingly efficient as well. In light of these developments, it is important to understand the benefits and drawbacks of edge and cloud computing capabilities in an Internet of Things framework. This paper examines the latency of currently available edge and cloud computing tools for vibration data acquisition, feature extraction, and health monitoring inference. Interestingly, both approaches are similarly efficient on average. The results of this work indicate that both computing paradigms are technically viable in an industrial setting and a decision on whether to use cloud or edge computing should be made based on other factors such as security, network bandwidth, and data availability._
