__A Tool Wear Classification Case Study for Edge Data Acquisition and Machine Learning Inference__

_The industrial Internet of Things promises to facilitate machine health monitoring through distributed data acquisition and long-term storage. To this end, few case studies in literature demonstrate health monitoring within a scalable framework. This paper leverages recent developments in data acquisition, Internet-of-Things messaging, and edge computing to demonstrate an end-to-end study of tool wear classification in a milling process. An experimental design with a range of milling process parameters is replicated for both a healthy and unhealthy cutting tool to generate a varied data set. Analysis is performed on these data to determine which features are most predictive of tool wear. After choosing a promising model from the training data, it is validated through deployment to the edge device._
