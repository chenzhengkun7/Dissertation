__An Open-Source Data Acquisition and Statistical Inference Device for Manufacturing Health Monitoring__

Daniel Newman, Thomas Kurfess, Andrew Dugenske

_In recent years, substantial research interest has been directed toward data acquisition and machine learning within the context of manufacturing health monitoring. To deploy such immensely useful technologies at scale, the hardware and software used to implement them must be reliable and cost-effective. Fortunately, recent developments have enabled advanced data acquisition and processing technology to be deployed with open-source, royalty-free hardware and software. This paper describes the design of an integrated data acquisition device which leverages these state-of-the-art, open-source tools. Relying on the BeagleBone platform, this data acquisition device leverages real-time-capable hardware and advanced machine learning software to incorporate sensor data acquisition and analysis in a single device. This same strategy is applied to CNC controller data as well, allowing an interface to MTConnect and OPC-UA protocols._

__Contextual Acquisition of Machine Health and Process Data in an IoT Framework__

This chapter describes the methodology and design of an architecture for transmitting machine data from a factory floor to cloud storage for analysis and historical monitoring. Specifically, this architecture leverages modern web protocols such as MQTT to enable low-overhead bidirectional communication for data acquisition devices in a factory setting. Using a standardized messaging format, communication across a variety of machines may be facilitated. This architecture also incorporates the use of additional sensors for health monitoring. By leveraging CNC controller data to indicate the current operational state of a machine, sensor data are readily contextualized relative to machine status. Two simple case studies illustrate the usefulness of sensor data in detecting tool wear and tracking spindle health in a milling machine.
