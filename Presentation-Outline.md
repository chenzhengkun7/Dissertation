# Presentation Outline

## Introduction: (7 minutes)

## Slide 1: Title (0:15)

Good afternoon and thank you for coming to my thesis defense. Before I begin, I want to draw your attention to the links at the bottom of this slide. I have made these slides, and the code used to generate them available online. All of the data used for this research is also available on Github.

### Slide 2: The Past Decade (2:00)

With that said, I want to begin by providing some context for this research. The work I'm about to present would have been impossible ten, five, or for some elements even two years ago. The advancements in embedded computing, machine learning, and Internet of Things have dramatically changed the technological landscape in the past decade. Many of these advancements are built on technologies first introduced in the mid 2000's. A couple of examples, shown here, are the 32-bit microprocessor architecture and the Numpy library. 
  
### Slide 3: Research Questions (1:15)

This research is specifically interested in how recent technological changes can be leveraged in a machine monitoring application. To that end, I am interested in answering these questions. 

...

Again, these questions essentially boil down to investigating how these new embedded computing and internet of things tools can be leveraged in a manufacturing environment

### Slide 4: Thesis Contributions (2:30)

Through investigating these questions, I will present an integrated Internet of Things architecture and data acquisition strategy that facilitates manufacturing machine health monitoring. Specifically, this architecture incorporates three major contributions. First, ...

...While previous work has addressed individual aspects of the work, a critical advancement from this thesis is the integration of all these elements from data acquisition to health monitoring. As a result, this work shows a truly end-to-end system which can be scaled to a manufacturing environment.

### Slide 8: Demonstration (1:00)

All of these elements are
